Displays a series of bitmap images stored on an SD card on a 2.1 inch TFT display 
upon boot.The ability to switch "modes" exists by using a push button to alternate 
between the "image display" mode and a "pattern" user defined mode. In my case this 
mode is used to display a personal message using bitmaps.

A small gift I made for my girlfriend on our 8th anniversary :)
